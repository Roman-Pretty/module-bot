## 1. Introduction

This handbook provides an overview of the final year undergraduate projects within the School of Electronic
Engineering and Computer Science. Please read and follow the guidelines within this handbook.

The final year project allows you to demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and experience that you have gained during
your degree and to extend these by working individually on a research or development problem. Electronic
Engineering (EE) and Computer Science (CS) are both practical subjects, and potential employers are typically
very interested in the project as it is the key means by which you can demonstrate your ability to “do” EE or CS.

In addition to technical skills, the project will also involve communication, organisational, and time management
skills.

The work will be guided by a supervisor and is expected to occupy a quarter of your effort in the final year of your
degree.

### 1.1 Aims

The final year project is the most crucial element of your degree, as it gives you an opportunity to work on an
extensive piece of work within the areas of EE and CS. The project also allows you to demonstrate your problem-
solving abilities through applying a range of skills that you have acquired through your UG studies to date.

The final year project aims for you to:

- Draw^ on^ knowledge,^ skills^ and^ experience^ gained^ from^ the^ modules^ you^ have^ taken^ in^ your^ degree.^
- Undertake an independent piece of work of appropriate scope and complexity, under the guidance of a project
    supervisor.
- Communicate^ the^ achievements^ of^ the^ project^ effectively^ in^ a^ written^ report^ and^ a^ viva.^
- Demonstrate^ the^ outcomes^ of^ the^ project,^ where^ applicable.^


### 2. PROJECT SUPPORT

There will be a series of lectures given by the Project Coordinator to support you in your project. There is also an
area on QM+ where the lecture slides can be found, along with other supporting material. You are expected to
watch any interactive videos and read relevant articles before the live webinar session.

There is a forum on QM+ for the projects where discussions can take place. This will be monitored by the Project
Coordinator, who will answer questions or signpost you to where you can find the relevant information.

```
Your engagement with the module will be monitored throughout the year. If we notice you are not
engaging with the project work, attending supervision meetings or lectures we will get in touch to
check in with you.
```
```
If you are struggling with your project for any reason or are unsure where to go for help, please
contact your supervisor or the Project Coordinator c.revell@qmul.ac.uk
```

## 3. Types of Projects

Most students will work on an implementation project, but there are other possibilities. In addition to projects
suggested by a supervisor, you can suggest your own. In this case you would need to find a supervisor who
considers that the level of difficulty of the project you have suggested is appropriate and is willing to supervise
you.

Please note that your project must be aligned with the learning outcomes of your programme of study (e.g. BSc
Computer Science, BEng Electronic Engineering et al). A breakdown of the learning outcomes can be found under
the headings: ‘Academic Content’, ‘Disciplinary Skills’ and ‘Attributes’ in the Programme Specifications for your
specific degree.

### 3 .1 Implementation

Implementation projects solve a practical problem. They may be hardware based, software based or a combination
of hardware and software. An implementation project will involve all the normal stages of the design and
development of a system (the proposed solution to the problem): specification, design, implementation, and
testing.

### 3.2 Research

A research project explores a hypothesis through the ‘scientific method’. In EECS, it must be based on technology
and must be a genuine research task. It must be original work, for example a review of existing work in an area or
a simple business analysis would not be an acceptable research project.

### 3 .3 Industrial

An industrial project is one that is carried out in cooperation with an external partner, i.e. a business. It can be
either a research based or an implementation project. In this situation there needs to be an industrial supervisor
who agrees to support your project as well as an academic supervisor from the School of EECS.

Industrial projects may originate from external contacts that academic staff have or from your own contacts. It is
the responsibility of the academic supervisor to ensure that the level of difficulty of the project is appropriate.

### 3 .4 User Study

A user study is a research project that is focused on studying user behaviour in a specific context. It would normally
include some implementation, e.g. building a prototype or an application as part of experiment design and setup,
and an experimental evaluation of user behaviour in the emulated context of interest.


## 4. Project Supervision

### 4.1 Selecting a Project and Supervisor

On the 7thMay 2024 a list of project supervisors with their project ideas and areas of interest will be published
on QM+. You should use this information to decide which members of staff you would like to contact to discuss
your project.

Procedure for supervisor selection and allocation

1. Read the supervisor profiles and project information on the QM+ page: UG Project Supervisors 2024/25.
    Make sure you carefully consider all the information contained here before emailing a potential supervisor.
2. Before contacting a supervisor, download and complete the ‘Initial Proposal Form’ from the QM+ page:
    Undergraduate Final Year Project 2024/
3. Complete ‘Supervisor Shortlist Form’
4. Contact the potential supervisor by sending them an email with your completed initial proposal form. It is
    important that when you contact academics that you demonstrate a keen interest and are well-informed
    about the potential project idea and/or the supervisor’s areas of specialism.
5. As soon as you have an agreement with a supervisor, you must a) make all other potential supervisors
    you were communicating with aware that you will be supervised by another academic and b) stop
    contacting any further supervisors.
6. The deadline for supervision selection is 31 st August 2024. If you have not found a supervisor by then
    you will be allocated one by the Project Coordinator by the start of Week 1 in Semester A. Please be
    aware that these allocations cannot be guaranteed to align perfectly with your interests. Therefore, it is
    vital that you are proactive in finding a supervisor BEFORE the August deadline.

Supervisors have a quota of project students, and the number of vacancies for taking on students will be updated
online as students are claimed. Changing supervisors, once you have one, needs the agreement of your old and
new supervisors.

### 4 2 Keeping in Contact with your Supervisor

It is important to meet with your supervisor regularly. Supervisors will have different preferences for how they want
to conduct supervision meetings – either individually or as a group. The dates and times for these meetings should
be agreed between you. If you have a particular issue that cannot be dealt with in a regular meeting, email your
supervisor and ask for an additional appointment. Bear in mind that academics have a busy schedule and
sometimes may be away or unavailable due to other commitments. Do factor this into your project planning and
try to be as flexible as possible.


Remember that your time with your supervisor is limited so to get the most out of the sessions you should:

- Prepare. It isn’t helpful (for you or your supervisor) to just turn up to the meeting without having done any
    planning in advance. This is your project so think about what you want to get out of the meeting, what you
    wish to discuss and what specific advice or help you are looking for from your supervisor.
- Highlight any key issues/challenges.
- Inform the supervisor of any progress you have made since the previous meeting (where relevant).
- Make your own notes of what is discussed.
- Keep a project logbook/journal to keep track of your progress, your ideas, any challenges and what is
    discussed in your supervision meetings. Getting into the habit of doing this will help you to plan your work
    and the logbook will be a very useful resource to look back on when you are writing your report and preparing
    for your viva.

IMPORTANT: If your project is not going well, tell your supervisor about it. You should NOT stop going to meetings.
Alternatively, if you think some general advice and support would be helpful, contact the Project Coordinator.

### 4.3 Student Responsibilities

- To^ monitor^ the^ project^ progress.^ Your^ role^ is^ essentially^ the^ project^ leader^ whereas^ the^ supervisor^ is^ more^
    like a consultant and manager.
- To^ maintain^ regular^ contact^ and^ arrange^ appointments^ with^ your^ supervisor.^

```
IMPORTANT: Remember that your project is marked by a supervisor and a second examiner. The second
examiner may require further details regarding evidence of your implementation/practical work so will be
relying on your supervisor to confirm this when it comes to the final assessment. If you have not maintained
regular contact with your supervisor, both they and the second examiner will not be able to assess the
quality of your work sufficiently.
```
- To^ be^ self-motivated^ and^ proactive.^ Your^ supervisor^ will^ not^ chase^ you^ up^ or^ do^ the^ work^ for^ you.^
- To^ gain^ the^ knowledge^ required^ independently^ and^ deal^ with^ implementation^ details.^ It^ is^ not^ the^
    responsibility of the supervisor to provide ready-made solutions. You should formulate any problems before
    asking your supervisor for help.
- To^ tell^ your^ supervisor^ about^ any^ equipment^ failure,^ technical^ or^ other^ difficulties,^ e.g.^ extenuating^
    circumstances, that could have a detrimental impact on your work or deadlines. If you are uncomfortable
    discussing any personal situations with your supervisor, please contact the Project Coordinator and/or the
    EECS Student Support staff.
- To^ respect^ academic^ staff^ time^ and^ to^ factor^ this^ into^ your^ planning^ and^ time^ management.^ You^ can^ expect^
    to receive a response to emails and phone messages from your supervisor or the Project Coordinator within
    five working days (this does not include weekends and holidays). If there is no response from your
    supervisor within this time, then please notify the Project Coordinator.


### 4.4 Supervisor Responsibilities

- It^ is^ the^ supervisor’s^ responsibility^ to^ define^ the^ project^ objectives^ and^ the^ possible^ outcomes,^ or^ to^ refine^
    these and check whether they are adequate if you have suggested your own project.
- The^ supervisor^ will^ provide^ advice^ and^ guidance^ but^ leave^ solutions^ and^ implementation^ details^ to^ the^
    student.
- The^ supervisor^ will^ explain^ the^ project^ assessment^ method^ to^ the^ student^ and^ be^ responsible^ for^ evaluating^
    the student’s project in terms of quality and quantity of the effort expended.
- The^ project^ title^ and^ specification^ are^ a^ joint^ responsibility^ of^ the^ supervisor^ and^ student.^ The^ supervisor^ is^
    responsible for assessing the interim report, progress presentation and will be one of the assessors for the
    final deliverable of the project, which includes a demonstration and viva.
- Your^ supervisor^ is^ not^ obliged^ to^ chase^ you^ if^ you^ fail^ to^ keep^ appointments^ with^ them.^
- Supervisors^ are^ asked^ to^ notify^ the^ Project^ Coordinator^ if^ you^ are^ not^ engaging^ with^ the^ project^ nor^ attending^
    meetings.


## 5. Project Outputs and Weighting

### 5.1 Project Weighting

The project is a core module which you must pass to be awarded your degree.

The overall weighting of your project in the calculation for your final degree is as follows:

#### 5 .1.1 Computer Science Programme Students

For Computer Science students, the project counts as two modules in the final year and is therefore 25% of the
final year mark or 15% of the overall degree classification. You must pass a “problem-solving project” at the first
attempt to qualify for partial exemption from the BCS membership examinations.

#### 5.1.2 Electronic Engineering Programme Students

For Electronic Engineering students, the project counts as two modules in the final year and is therefore 25% of
the final year mark or 15% of the overall degree classification.

### 5.2 Project Documentation

There are a series of documents relating to your project that you need to produce and submit at different points
in the year.

These are:

- Project^ definition^ including^ a^ project^ plan.^
- Interim^ report^ including^ a^ revised^ project^ plan^ and^ a^ risk^ assessment.^
- Project^ progress^ presentation.^
- Final^ report.^
- Showcase^ video.^
- Any^ supporting^ documentation.^

All documents are to be submitted via QM+.

## 6. Project Assessment

### 6.1 Project Definition and Plan

You are required to submit a project definition document on 16 th October 2024. This should be a 3 – 4 - page
description about your project. This document will also need to include a project plan.

#### 6.1.1 Project Definition

Your final achievements in your project will be judged against your project definition. It is possible to amend the
definition during your project, but any changes must be agreed with your supervisor. You will also need to keep a
record of any changes you make and the reasons for these.

Exactly what will appear in your project definition will vary with the nature of your project, but typically it will contain:

- Project^ Title^
- Project^ Aims^ –^ this^ should^ be^ a^ broad^ statement^ of^ what^ you^ intend^ overall.^ This^ can^ usually^ be^ summarized^
    in one sentence.
- Objectives^ –^ these^ will^ be^ more^ specific^ and^ measurable,^ relating^ to^ the^ expected^ outcomes^ of^ the^ project^
    and presented in a list format typically starting with a verb e.g. ‘Investigate’, ‘Develop’, ‘Design’, ‘Identify’
    and so on. There is no rule about how many objectives to include as this depends on what you consider
    to be appropriate.
- Details^ of^ the^ specific^ problem^ being^ addressed.^
- An^ initial^ analysis^ of^ user^ requirements^ and^ data^ collection^ methods.^
- The^ algorithms,^ methodologies,^ and^ techniques^ to^ be^ employed.^
- An^ initial^ specification^ of^ how^ users^ will^ interact^ with^ the^ system.^
- Programming^ languages,^ software,^ hardware,^ databases.^
- A^ list^ of^ background^ materials^ consulted^ so^ far,^ including^ Internet^ resources.^

Your project definition must state how your project will be aligned with the learning outcomes of your degree. A
breakdown of the learning outcomes can be found under the headings: ‘Academic Content’, ‘Disciplinary Skills’,
and ‘Attributes’ in the Programme Specifications for your specific programme.

The project definition must be agreed with your supervisor.

A pro forma is provided on QM+ for you to use to structure this.


#### 6.1.2 CONSTRUCTING A PROBLEM DEFINITION

An excellent project depends on the construction of a clear problem definition. Stating the problem to be solved
is more than just writing a series of anecdotal notes on the reasons that have motivated you to develop some
hardware or write a particular piece of software.

Your initial thoughts on a topic may be: ‘I have an interest in healthy living and wish to develop an application that
supports users within the elderly community by providing them with intelligent recommendations to lead an
independent and healthy lifestyle’. This would be a good starting point for a project, but it wouldn’t be sufficient
on its own. You will also need to conduct research to establish the specific areas of Electronic Engineering or
Computer Science that relate to your topic area.

The method to investigate the underlying problem will require reading books, and research articles (e.g. papers
from academic journals and conferences).

In relation to the healthy living example above, you would do the following:

- Read^ research^ articles^ on^ current^ software^ systems^ developed^ to^ encourage^ health^ and^ wellbeing^ within^
    elderly communities.
- Investigate^ and^ review^ the^ range^ of^ functionalities^ they^ support.^
- Identify^ issues^ and^ shortcomings.^
- Investigate^ current^ software^ frameworks^ adopted^ to^ solve^ this^ problem.^

It is essential that you have a clear idea of the underlying problem you are trying to solve, and you will only be
able to demonstrate this through engaging with the existing literature.

The following resources are excellent starting points for your research.

- ACM^ Digital^ Library^ -^ https://dl.acm.org^
- IEEE^ Xplore^ Digital^ Library^ -^ [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp)^
- Google^ Scholar^ -^ https://scholar.google.co.uk^

It is important that you create notes and summaries of the references that you find useful, as these will inform
your literature review, which is a significant component of your interim and final report.

### 6 .1. 2 Project Plan

Your project plan should break down the work you expect to carry out for your project into activities (tasks and
sub-tasks) and estimate how long each will take, whether one relies on the completion of another or can be
carried out in parallel, etc.

The deadlines that you have for producing documents and the practical work/implementation also appear on the
plan. You can use a Gantt chart or any other project management tools of your choice or create your own providing
a list of activities and their start and end dates. You will be asked to revise the time plan when you submit your


interim report so the first semester plan may have much more detail than the second semester plan. The plan
should also be discussed and agreed with your supervisor.

### 6.2 Interim Report & Project Progress Presentation

You will be expected to submit an interim report on 28 th November 2024. Submissions are via QM+ and all
reports will be passed through Turnitin. You will also be asked to present your interim report findings to your
supervisor during the week commencing 9 th December 2024. You should submit slides ahead of this
presentation on 4 th December 2024. The interim report and presentation are a great opportunity for you and
your supervisor to review the progress that you have made.

#### 6.2.1 Interim Report

The interim report is a subset of your final report. It should consist of:

- A^ literature^ review^ of^ previous^ work^ and^ the^ background^ to^ your^ project.^
- An^ account^ of^ your^ achievements^ to^ date.^
- An^ amended^ plan^ for^ the^ work^ you^ will^ carry^ out^ in^ the^ second^ semester.^
- Risk^ assessment.^

The risk assessment should consist of a list of any risks you have identified which could impact on the successful
completion of your project. This list should include a description of the possible risk, the impact it may have, the
likelihood of the risk occurring, the severity of the effect of the risk on your project and how you intend to manage
it. This should be presented in the form of a five-column table. The ratings will be low/medium/high.

```
Description of risk Impact of risk Likelihood rating Impact rating Preventative
actions
```
E.g. Some of the risks in hardware construction will be physical risks associated with construction activities.

#### 6.2.2 Project Progress Presentation

During the last week of semester A - 9 th- 13 th December 24 - you will be expected to prepare and deliver a 10 -
minute presentation to your supervisor, where you will:

- Provide^ an^ update^ on^ your^ project^ and^ your^ progress^ to^ date.^
- Summarise^ your^ literature^ review^ findings.^
- Describe^ how^ your^ project^ is^ aligned^ with^ the^ learning^ outcomes^ of^ your^ degree.^
- Explain^ the^ design^ of^ the^ proposed^ implementation.^
- Present^ your^ project^ plan,^ highlighting^ the^ milestones^ you^ have^ already^ achieved^ and^ the^ timeline^ for^
    meeting those you have remaining.


The interim report and project progress presentation will be marked by your supervisor and count as 5% towards
your final project mark.

#### 6.3 Final Report

The purpose of your report is to:

- Describe^ the^ project^ to^ the^ examiners.^
- Highlight^ your^ achievements^ and^ skills.^
- Show^ that^ you^ have^ evaluated^ your^ project^ and^ know^ the^ strengths^ and^
    limitations of the work you have carried out.
- Demonstrate^ that^ you^ can^ carry^ out^ a^ sustained^ piece^ of^ academic^ writing.^

You are required to submit a draft version of your final report to your supervisor on 27 th March 2025 so that you
can get feedback to improve the final submission.

Report Structure

The structure of your report will vary depending on the nature of the project. Typically for an implementation
project, there is: an introduction justifying the usefulness of the project; a review of previous work on the topic; a
requirements section; a design section; an implementation section; a testing section; conclusions; suggestions for
further work; and references.

In more detail the structure should include:

- Title^ Page^ -^ a^ template^ is^ provided^ on^ QM+^
- Acknowledgments
- Abstract^ -^ One^ page^ maximum,^ a^ concise^ summary^ of^ your^ work.^ A^ reader^ should^ be^ able^ to^ understand^ from^
    the abstract what your project is about without having to read the rest of the report. The abstract should be one
    of the last things you write in the report.
- Table^ of^ contents^
- Introduction^ - Context^ for^ the^ report^ and^ the^ motivation^ behind^ your^ work.^
- Background^ research^ and^ literature^ review^ –^ These^ chapters^ will^ focus^ on^ what^ others^ have^ done.^
- The^ next^ chapters^ will^ focus^ on^ what^ you^ have^ done^ e.g.^
    - Requirements^ capture^ /^ analysis^ –^ what^ your^ system^ should^ do^
    - Design^ –^ how^ you^ went^ about^ your^ work^
    - Implementation^ –^ practical^ techniques,^ problems,^ solutions^
    - Testing^ and/or^ evaluation^ –^ how^ well^ your^ solution^ worked^
- Discussion/Conclusions^ - This^ should^ be^ a^ critical^ analysis^ of^ your^ work^ and^ an^ honest^ appraisal^ of^ the^
    achievements of your project.
- Further^ work^ - What^ more^ you^ would^ do^ if^ you^ had^ time?^
- References/Bibliography
- Appendices^ -^ More^ detailed^ material^ that^ is^ relevant^ but^ not^ crucial^ to^ the^ understanding^ of^ the^ main^
    message(s), e.g. Detailed experimental results, data sheets, copy of questionnaire / interview scripts.


The report length should be 10,000 words (+/-10%). This excludes references and appendices. Use 12 - point
type and make sure that figures and tables have captions. The Report Template (Word document) which is
available on QM+ should be used for structuring your report.

The submission deadline for your report is 6 th May 2025. This will be assessed by your supervisor and second
examiner. Submission is electronic via QM+ and all reports will be passed through Turnitin. Any computer code in
text format should be submitted as a separate file under supporting documentation.

Disclaimer
Please note: The project report you submit could be used as an exemplar for future students. These exemplars
will be anonymous (i.e. we will remove any information that could make it possible to identify you). If you would
like to opt out of this completely OR are happy for your name to remain in the report (should people want to cite
your work) please email the Project Coordinator.

#### 6.4 Project Viva

The viva assessment will be split into two subcomponents:

- Project Showcase Video
- Viva Q&A Session

The viva will be assessed by your supervisor and second examiner. The viva is not marked separately from the
report and should not be treated as a separate component of the project. Both are taken into consideration before
a final grade is decided. Please note that your performance in the viva can increase or decrease the overall mark
you are given.

#### 6.4.1 Project Showcase Video

Video is a powerful medium to disseminate your project as it gives you an opportunity to showcase your work to
a wider audience and provide further insights.

You will need to create a 10 - minute video (+/-10% duration), where you will be expected to provide an overview
of your project and contributions. This is a unique opportunity for you to convince your examiners that your project
is high quality and interesting.

The purpose of the video will be to provide an overview of the:

- area^ you^ worked^ in,^
- problem^ you^ focused^ on,^
- solution^ you^ designed^ and^ implemented.^

The video is an opportunity for creativity. However, it is important that you cover the following aspects of your
work:

- the statement of the problem you investigated,
- the description of the methods used to solve the problem,


- a demonstration of your practical/implementation work,
- a summary of your work,
- a presentation of your results (both positive and negative).

The submission deadline for your video is 8 th May 2025 via QM+.

#### 6.4.2 Viva Q&A Session

During the weeks commencing 12 th - 23 rd May 2025 you will be allocated a 20 - minute timeslot for your viva
where you will be assessed by your supervisor and a second examiner on your ability to answer questions about
your project. Questions will cover your contributions (i.e., methodology and demo), and the
implementation/practical aspects (i.e., coding or experiments) of your project.

The objectives of the viva session are for you:

- To^ explain^ and^ justify^ your^ work.^
- To^ demonstrate^ your^ ability^ to^ respond^ to^ questions^ about^ your^ project.^

NB: Your second examiner may not be an expert in the field of your project, so you need to ensure that you
articulate your project findings in a clear and concise manner.

Please note that a viva Q&A session cannot take place if two examiners are not present.

##### IMPORTANT!

- You must appear on camera in the showcase video. A voice-over alone will not meet the
    requirements. If you fail to appear in the video your viva Q&A session cannot take place.
- Your video must be recorded at normal speed. Any videos speeded up to keep within the 10
    min timeframe will lose marks!

If you fail to attend the viva, then you will receive a mark of zero for the project.

```
You will also fail your project if you do not submit the final report, supporting
documentation and project video.
```

## 8. Ethics and Projects that Involve Human Participants

The obvious ethical issues are fraud (e.g. passing off work that was done by someone else as your own) and
plagiarism (which will be discussed further in Section 10.4). However, projects that involve human participants,
e.g. user studies or experimental evaluations, also involve ethical issues. The principal issues are ensuring that
participants have given informed consent and that personal details are protected in accordance with the Data
Protection Act.

If your project involves human participants, you may need ethical approval. Information about this can be found
on the following site:

https://qmulprod.sharepoint.com/sites/EECS-DevolvedSchoolResearchEthicsCommittee

*If your project requires ethical approval, please include the related documents in the Appendix of your report*


## 9. Resources

### 9.1 Hardware

There is an area of the electronics laboratory for project hardware development, and you can request to be
allocated a cupboard space in the lab to keep your hardware and work on your project.

The electronics lab provides a supply of basic electronic parts, and you can take these from the carousel in the
3rd floor electronics lab. For other specific parts you must request that an order form is created. The Lab Manager
can authorise purchases up to £15, your supervisor up to £50. Anything above £50 must be authorized by the
Project Coordinator. The total maximum budget per project is £100. Check whether we have parts already before
you order anything, and we prefer that parts can be re-used. Any items purchased yourself cannot be reimbursed.
The project remains the property of QMUL and should be returned to the Lab upon completion.

Be careful about the package that integrated circuits use. Standard DIL packages are good for development on
breadboard and strip board, but surface mount parts must have adequate adapters or fabrication of a suitable PCB
must be considered before purchasing. If you need to have a PCB manufactured, also see the PCB technician to
discuss complexity and lead times for manufacture. All purchasing and fabrications need to have been authorised
appropriately before purchase or works are commenced.

You can check a general guide to the items stocked in the lab at: [http://services.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/eecs-](http://services.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/eecs-)
laboratories/electronics-labs/components/.

All components not available in the carousel still need to be ordered, even if stocked.

To request a cupboard/order form email electronicslab@lists.eecs.qmul.ac.uk and copy your supervisor.

If you are using microcontrollers, check that we have access to a software development environment and
programming capability for your chosen part.

NB: The budget is only for hardware-based projects where you require electronic components to build a system.
It does not include ‘off the shelf’ products that are add-ons to your system.

### 9.2 Software

Final year students have access to the EECS Teaching Lab when no scheduled teaching is taking place (check lab
timetables via your landing page). There may be times where you will still be able to access any unused machines
during a scheduled lab but please be considerate of others and remember that teaching takes priority.

All the software you need should be available, but if you think you need something else, please consult the ITS
team and your supervisor.


## 10. Referencing and Plagiarism

### 10.1 Referencing

A crucial aspect of any academic writing is ensuring that it is properly referenced. This means that any sources
that have informed what you have written in your report must be acknowledged. These also need to be written
correctly following a standard referencing system. The two main referencing systems are the Harvard and
Vancouver styles. The Harvard system has the author’s name and year appearing in the text, which links to a list
at the end of the document. The Vancouver system has a number appearing in the text as a superscript or in
brackets, which links to a list at the end of the document. The Faculty of Science and Engineering at QM requires
students to use the Harvard system ONLY.

It takes practice to get referencing right so familiarize yourself with the Harvard system early on and keep a working
bibliography and a list of citations as you go along. This will help you to avoid having to do this from scratch when
writing your final report and save you lots of time!

### 10.2 The Harvard System

In the text

In his recent article, Leyden claimed that Google’s new IM service has had a less-than-enthusiastic reception, “Early
reaction to the service has been lukewarm.” (Leyden 2005)

Reid and Dunlop (2003) stated that...

Beymer et al (2005) stated that... (3 or more authors)

### 10 .4 Plagiarism

Plagiarism effectively means presenting the work of others without stating where it has come from (sourcing), or
to put it simply, trying to pass off someone else’s work as your own. Queen Mary defines ‘plagiarism’ as:

“...presenting someone else’s work as one’s own, irrespective of intention. Close paraphrasing; copying from the
work of another person, including another student; using the ideas of another person without proper
acknowledgement; and repeating work that you have previously submitted – at Queen Mary or at another
institution – without properly referencing yourself (known as ‘self-plagiarism’) also constitute plagiarism.
Unfortunately, including material without proper acknowledgement has become far too common and QMUL takes
a very firm line on any such offences.” From the QMUL Academic Misconduct Policy 2023/24

If you are suspected of plagiarism, you will be reported to the Academic Registrar for an examination offence under
the QMUL Regulations for Assessment Offences. Under these Regulations, students found to have committed an
offence may have their whole diet of assessments invalidated or be expelled from the College.

A range of methods, including special software tools such as TurnItIn, are used to detect plagiarism, and project
reports are routinely put through an electronic plagiarism detection system.


## 11. Time Management

Managing your time over the two semesters is an important part of your project. You will have a time plan, but
this needs to be flexible as you won’t know in advance how long things will take. Take time to research, read,
think, and discuss with others before diving in.

Plan for slippage and have a contingency plan. Revisit and review your plans and progress regularly. Do not lie to
yourself - or anyone else - about your progress! Be honest if things aren’t going as planned and talk this through
with your supervisor or the Project Coordinator.

Steady work throughout the period is important for success in your project. You cannot leave most of the work
until the last month. Remember to leave enough time to write the final report, as this will be very important in how
your success is judged.

The project is a core component of your final year, but remember you also have other modules to complete so do
factor these in. Make sure you are aware of the deadlines and demands you will have throughout the year and
allow for these in your planning.


## 12. Project Marking Policy.................................................................................................................

Project marking policy for undergraduate projects:

- The^ pass^ mark^ for^ the^ project^ is^ 40%.^
- The^ final^ report,^ video^ and^ viva^ are^ worth^9 5%^ of^ the^ final^ project^ mark.^ This^ is^ assessed^ by^ two^ examiners^
    (supervisor and second examiner).
- When^ there^ is^ a^ discrepancy^ of^ 10%^ or^ less^ between^ the^ marks^ of^ both^ examiners^ then^ the^ average^ is^ taken^
    as the final mark unless marks span pass/fail.
- When there is a discrepancy of 10% or less between the marks of both examiners and the marks span the
    pass/fail borderline, then both examiners will discuss for agreement, if no agreement then the project will be
    assessed by a third examiner.
- When^ there^ is^ a^ discrepancy^ greater^ than^ 10%^ between^ the^ marks^ of^ both^ examiners^ but^ it^ is^ within^ the^ same^
    grade i.e. A or F, then the average is taken as the final mark.
- When^ there^ is^ a^ discrepancy^ greater^ than^ 10%^ between^ the^ marks^ of^ both^ examiners,^ across^ different^ grades,^
    then both examiners discuss for agreement. However, if no agreement is reached then the project will be
    assessed by a third examiner.
- Third^ examiner^ marks^ will^ account^ for^9 5%^ of^ the^ final^ project^ mark.^ The^ remaining^ 5%^ relating^ to^ the^ interim^
    report/progress presentation will have already been awarded earlier in the year so cannot be changed.
- Normally^ the^ third^ examiner^ mark^ remains^ within^ the^ original^ two^ examiner^ marks.^


## 13. Resitting a Project

If you do not pass your project in the May exam period, a late summer resit is possible. This involves submitting a
revised report, supporting material and project showcase video at the beginning of the late summer resit exam
period, and attending a viva Q&A session towards the end of it. If the project is passed on resit the mark will be
capped at 40%, as with any other resit exam or coursework.

```
- Adequacy and rigour of testing
- Quality of the documentation of
    testing
- Critical analysis of results
- Analysis of
    strengths/weaknesses
- Presentation of possibilities for
    further work
- Critical analysis of the
    relationship between theory and

    Ethical Issues and Sustainability

Determined by viva and report (^13)
For design & build,
integration, or software-
based projects, testing is
insufficient or poorly
designed, so that it does
not support the claims.
For a research-based
project, there is no critical
analysis of the results.
Weaknesses and
improvements are not
considered.
For both types of projects,
critical analysis is not
attempted.
Documentation is poor.
There is no reference to the
legal, social and ethical
issues and sustainability.
For design & build,
integration, or software-
based projects, testing is
attempted but is not
complete or has design
flaws.
Testing documentation
lacks detail or is incomplete.
For a research-based
project, the critical analysis
of the results is trivial.
Weaknesses are only
partially identified.
For both types of projects,
the the evaluation is limited,

informal observations, or
the results do not fully bear
out the conclusions.
Documentation is patchy; it
provides information but not
insight. Description of
procedures lack detail.
Result tables do not support
drawing of conclusions.
There is a very brief
reference to the legal, social
and ethical issues and
sustainability.
For design & build,
integration, or software-
based projects, testing
may be designed and
planned well, but it is not
comprehensive, or it may
lack rigour. Not all
requirements are fully
verified by testing.
For a research-based
project, critical analysis of
results is presented but
may lack rigour or may
present some reasoning
flaws. Weaknesses and
improvements have
partially been considered,
but some gaps remain.

the evaluation lacks rigour
in execution and
reasoning.
Documentation enables
replication of tests. Tables
are used appropriately to
document test conditions
and results and support
drawing of conclusions.
There is awareness of the
legal, social and ethical
issues and sustainability,
but complex issues are
not explored.
For design & build,
integration, or software-
based projects, testing
verifies majority of
requirements using rigorous
and well-documented
procedures with only minor
flaws.
For a research-based
project, there is evidence of
critical analysis of results.
Weaknesses and
improvements have been
considered to some depth.
For both types of projects,
documentation provides the
detail that enables scrutiny
and replication of tests.
For both type of projects,
the student adopted
rigorous evaluation process
and the results fully support
conclusions.
There is awareness of the
legal, social and ethical
issues and sustainability
that goes beyond the
obvious or the trivial.
For design & build,
integration, or software-based
projects, there is evidence of
thorough and flawless testing.
For a research-based project,
there is critical analysis of the
results. Weaknesses and
improvements have been fully
thought out with well-
supported arguments.
For both types of projects,
the evaluation provides an
evidence-based critical
analysis of the project,
drawing strongly on deep
discipline knowledge.
Documentation is detailed,
methodical, rigorous, and
clear, enabling replication of
tests and proper scrutiny of
results.
There is a clear awareness of
the legal, social and ethical
issues and sustainability, with
some complex issues teased
out.
For design & build, integration,
or software-based projects
there is comprehensive testing.
Analysis of strengths &
weaknesses are present.
Documentation is outstanding
(includes details to allow
replication).
